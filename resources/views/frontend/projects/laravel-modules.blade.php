@section('description')
    <p>
        Laravel Modules is a Laravel package designed to help build modular apps
        using modules. A module is like a Laravel package; it has some views, controllers
        and models. The package is supported and tested in Laravel 5.
    </p>

    <p>
        The package isn't all my idea; I took the
        <b-link href="https://github.com/nWidart/laravel-modules" target="_blank">nWidart/laravel-modules</b-link> package and modified
        it to fit my own needs. I wanted to have full control over how modules are created and managed,
        and I mostly developed this package for my own use.
