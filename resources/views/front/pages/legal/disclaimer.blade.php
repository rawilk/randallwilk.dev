                        are clearly listed on the website and the rights and obligations defined in the disclaimer and

                        These general terms and conditions apply to both me, RANDALL WILK, as well as for you, the User.
                        Once you use my website you expressly acknowledge and accept that our general terms and conditions

                    <h2>My website</h2>
                    <h3>Good operation, safety and accessibility</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can rest assured, I offer an easy-to-use website that is safe for each User. I take all
                        reasonable measures necessary to ensure the proper operation, safety and accessibility of my
                        website. However, I can give you no absolute guarantees, and you must regard my measures as
                        an obligation of means.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any use of the website is always at your own risk. This means that I carry no liability for
                        damages resulting from malfunctions, interruptions, defects or harmful elements to the website,
                        regardless of the existence of a strange cause.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have the right to limit access to my website at any time and/or suspend it in whole or in
                        part, without prior warning. I do this in principle only where the circumstances justify this,
                        but this is not an absolute condition.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Site content</h3>
                    <p>
                        The content of the website is solely determined by me and I take great care in this content.
                        This means that I take the necessary measures to ensure that my website is as complete,
                        accurate and up to date as possible, even when the content is provided by third parties. The
                        content on my website can always be amended, supplemented or deleted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, I can give no guarantees about the quality of the information on my website. It is
                        possible that the information is not complete, sufficiently accurate and/or useful. I am
                        therefore not liable for (direct and indirect) damage the User suffers as a result of the
                        information on my website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In case certain content on my website is a violation of applicable law and/or a violation of
                        the rights of third parties and/or simply is unacceptable, I ask you to report this to me as
                        soon as possible so that I can take appropriate measures, so that I can proceed to a partial
                        or entire removal and/or adaptation of the content.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What I expect from you as a User</h3>
                    <p>
                        The User also bears a certain responsibility when using my website. the User should always
                        refrain from actions which may have a harmful impact on the proper functioning and security of
                        the website. As such my website may not be used to circumvent my business model and/or to
                        collect information from other Users on a large scale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is therefore not allowed to use my website for the distribution of content that can cause
                        damage to other Users of the website, such as spreading of malicious software such as
                        computer viruses, malware, worms, Trojans and cancel bots. The distribution of unsolicited
                        and/or commercial messages via the website, such as chain letters, junk email, spamming is also
                        included in this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I reserve the right to take all the necessary actions that can produce recovery for me and
                        for my Users, both at the judicial and extrajudicial level. The User is personally and solely
                        responsible if their actions and behavior can cause effective damage to the website and other
                        Users. In that case they must hold RANDALL WILK harmless from any damage claim that follows.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Links to other websites</h2>
                    <p>
                        The content of my website can contain a link, hyperlink or framed link to external websites or
                        other forms of electronic portals. A link does not automatically mean that there is a link
                        between us and the external website, nor that we (implicitly) agree with the content of these
                        websites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I keep no check on these external websites and am not responsible for the safe and correct
                        operation of the link and the final destination. As soon as you click on the link, you will
                        leave my website and one can no longer hold us liable for any damage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is possible that the external websites do not offer the same guarantees as I do. Therefore,
                        I recommend to read carefully the general terms and conditions and the privacy statement of
                        these websites.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Intellectual property</h2>
                    <p>
                        Creativity deserves protection, as well as my website and its content. The protection is
                        provided for by intellectual property rights and belongs to all beneficiary parties, being
                        RANDALL WILK and third parties. Under content, one means the very side category of photos, video,
                        audio, text, ideas, notes, drawings, articles, etc. All such content is protected by copyright

                        property rights. The technical nature of my website itself is protected by copyright, the software
                        and database law. Each trade name that I use on my websites is also protected
                        by the trade names law or applicable trademark law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each User gets a limited right to access, use and display of my web sites and its content. This
                        granted right is non-exclusive, non-transferable and may be used in a personal,
                        non-commercial context. I ask my Users not to use and/or to make changes to the rights
                        protected business, without the consent of the beneficiary. RANDALL WILK attaches great importance to its
                        intellectual property rights and has taken all possible measures to ensure the protection.
                        Any breach of the existing intellectual property rights will be pursued.

                    <h2>General provisions concerning the general terms and conditions</h2>
                    <p>
                        I retain the freedom to make changes to my website and related services at any time, to
                        expand, limit or stop them. This can be done without prior notifications of the User adn neither
                        gives rise to any form of compensation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the operation or validity of one or more of the above provisions of these general terms and
                        conditions will be in jeopardy, this will have no effect on the validity of the remaining
                        provisions of this agreement. In such case I have the right to change the provision concerned
                        with a valid provision of similar effect.
