        <p>
            I was using a 2019 Intel-based 27" iMac prior to this and the difference is night and day. No matter how
            many apps I have running or how much load I put it under, the MacBook Pro continues to perform beautifully.
            It's also extremely quiet; I haven't even heard the fans spin up once since I've had this laptop.
        </p>

        <p>
            The MacBook has the M1 Pro processor, 32 GB RAM and a 1 TB SSD.

            does an amazing job for a docking station. It's a little expensive, but it has everything I was looking for in a
            docking station.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm able to connect both my monitors, my external drive for backups, ethernet, and more all with a single
            cable running to the MacBook. As a plus, it also charges the MacBook at the same time.

        <p>
            At the office, I'm usually docked and use two 32" monitors from LG in addition to the built-in screen from
            the MacBook. Here's the
            <x-front.legal-link url="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YGZRQ98/" target="_blank" text="link" />
            to buy them, however I don't think they're available for purchase anymore, unfortunately.

    <x-front.section-list-item title="Monitor Arms">

            I prefer using monitor arms over the default stand that most monitors come with, and I ended up going with two

            They hold the monitors in place nicely, and are pretty flexible and where I can position them.

            fits the bill nicely. Since I usually dock to external monitors, it's easier to use an external keyboard,
            plus this keyboard also provides a numeric keypad.

            I just recently started using the

            and so far I'm in love with it. As much as I like the magic keyboard, this one just feels better to type on
            for long periods of time. I got mine with blue switches, so it's loud and clicky, which is what I was
            looking for in a keyboard.

    <x-front.section-list-item title="Logitech MX Master 3 Mouse">

            Even when not docked, I still prefer an external mouse for most operations. I really love the

            mouse. For me, it feels great to hold, and it also provides support for some macOS gestures like swiping up
            for mission control.

            works as a great companion. I could just use the trackpad on the MacBook, however having the trackpad close
            to me is more convenient.

            security key. This particular key is nice because it works with both my MacBook and my iPhone without having
            to use any adapters.
        </p>

        <p>
            I highly recommend purchasing at least one of these to use a form of two-factor authentication for websites

            provides a convenient way to wirelessly charge my phone at the office, and also acts as a nice stand to keep
            my phone off the desk. It's MagSafe too, which is a plus.
