            I like to use Laravel for most projects and when I can I love to contribute to the Laravel ecosystem.

        <p>
            In the past if I needed some kind of functionality in an application, I would just write it into the application
            itself and forget about it. If I needed that same functionality on another project, I would just copy and paste
            it over, modifying as needed. Obviously this wasn't very sustainable, so I've extracted some packages that either
            I need to reuse or that I think others may find useful.
