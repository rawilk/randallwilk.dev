        <p>
            I was using a 2019 Intel-based 27" iMac prior to this and the difference is night and day. No matter how
            many apps I have running or how much load I put it under, the MacBook Pro continues to perform beautifully.
            It's also extremely quiet; I haven't even heard the fans spin up once since I've had this laptop.
        </p>

        <p>
            The MacBook has the M1 Pro processor, 32 GB RAM and a 1 TB SSD.

    <x-front.section-list-item title="OWC 11-Port Thunderbolt Dock">
        <p>
            I looked at a lot of docks, and I've found that the
            <x-front.legal-link url="https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/owc-thunderbolt-dock" target="_blank" text="OWC 11-Port Thunderbolt Dock" />
            does an amazing job for a docking station. It's not the cheapest dock, but it has everything I was looking for in a
            docking station.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm able to connect both my monitors, my external drive for backups, ethernet, and more all with a single
            cable running to the MacBook. As a plus, it also charges the MacBook at the same time.

    <x-front.section-list-item title="LG 32UN500-W 32-Inch Monitor x2">
        <p>
            At home and at the office, I'm usually docked and use two 32" monitors from LG in addition to the built-in screen from
            the MacBook. Here's the
            <x-front.legal-link url="https://www.amazon.com/LG-32UN500-W-Compatibility-Virtually-Borderless-dp-B08FPLLX6Y/dp/B08FPLLX6Y/ref=dp_ob_title_ce?th=1" target="_blank" text="link" />
            to buy them.

    <x-front.section-list-item title="Monitor Arm">
        <p>
            I prefer using monitor arms over the default stand that most monitors come with, and at the end of 2022 I switched to the
            <x-front.legal-link url="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CXJPQG9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank" text="HUANUO Dual Monitor Stand" after="." />
            It's a single mount with two monitor arms, and it holds the monitors in place nicely.
            Each arm is flexible in where I can position them.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was previously using two separate monitor arms, but I felt having one single mount was much nicer and provided me
            with a cleaner setup.

        <p>
            By far the best mechanical keyboard I've ever used. The
            <x-front.legal-link url="https://epomaker.com/products/epomaker-aula-f99?_pos=1&_sid=d2ca2dab0&_ss=r" target="_blank" text="Epomaker x Aula F99 Keyboard" />
            looks and sounds amazing out-of-the-box.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, I chose to put in

            tactile switches, along with some
            <x-front.legal-link

            />.
            I love how the baby kangaroo switches sound and feel, and the retro keycaps paired nicely with this board in my opinion.
        </p>

        <p>
            My only complaint with this board is how much it flexes when changing out the switches.

    <x-front.section-list-item title="Logitech MX Master 3s Mouse">
        <p>
            Even when not docked, I still prefer an external mouse for most operations. I really love the

            mouse. For me, it feels great to hold, and it also provides support for some macOS gestures like swiping up
            for mission control.

        provides a great solution for elevating the MacBook off the desk and I think it looks great.

            I never was much of a watch person until I bought my Apple Watch Series 7. Now I feel naked if I leave home

        <p>
            For websites and services that support Webauthn authentication, I use a
            <x-front.legal-link url="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5c-nfc/" target="_blank" text="YubiKey 5C NFC" />
            security key. This particular key is nice because it works with both my MacBook and my iPhone without having
            to use any adapters.
        </p>

        <p>
            I highly recommend purchasing at least one of these to use a form of two-factor authentication for websites
            that support it.

            provides a convenient way to wirelessly charge my phone at the office, and also acts as a nice stand to keep
            my phone off the desk. It's MagSafe too, which is a plus.

            when I found it. The quality and size of the pad are great and worth every penny.
