    <x-front.section-list-item title="16-inch MacBook Pro — M4 Max — Space Black">
        <p>
            I've upgraded a lot of things in my setup in 2024-2025, and now my MacBook is the latest upgrade. I was using a
            16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, and now I've decided to get a 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 Max. To be honest, I didn't really
            <em>need</em> to upgrade, but I really wanted to.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, I'm loving the M4 Max so far, and I've noticed that it does handle certain tasks such as running Pest PHP
            tests about twice as fast sometimes as the M1 Pro did, which is nice.
        </p>

        <p>
            This MacBook has the 16‑core CPU, 40‑core GPU version of the M4 Max Chip, as well as 64 GB of RAM, and a 2 TB SSD. While
            these specs are largely overkill for what I need the MacBook for, I just wanted to basically have the highest-end MacBook Pro
            for once.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also opted for the Nano-texture display upgrade with this MacBook, and I'm definitely glad I did. I honestly can't really tell
            much of a difference between this display and the glossy display on my last MBP, however not having a lot of glare on the screen
            is very nice in areas where I can't really control the lighting.

    <x-front.section-list-item title="OWC 11-Port Thunderbolt Dock">
        <p>
            I looked at a lot of docks, and I've found that the
            <x-front.legal-link url="https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/owc-thunderbolt-dock" target="_blank" text="OWC 11-Port Thunderbolt Dock" />
            does an amazing job for a docking station. It's not the cheapest dock, but it has everything I was looking for in a
            docking station.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm able to connect both my monitors, my external drive for backups, ethernet, and more all with a single
            cable running to the MacBook. As a plus, it also charges the MacBook at the same time.

        <p>
            I've been upgrading my home office setup, and these monitors have been part of that upgrade. So far I'm very happy with the picture
            and color quality of the monitors, and the pricing really wasn't too bad either. Here's the
            <x-front.legal-link url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3FGFPPB?th=1" target="_blank" text="link" />

        <p>
            While at the office, I'm usually docked and use two 32" monitors from LG in addition to the built-in screen from
            the MacBook. Here's the

                after="."
            />
            Overall, I love this desk so far. The bamboo top looks and feels great, and I have plenty of room on the desk to set it up how I want to.
            Being able to raise it to a standing position is also nice too when I get sick of sitting.

    <x-front.section-list-item title="Monitor Arm">
        <p>
            I prefer using monitor arms over the default stand that most monitors come with, and at the end of 2022 I switched to the
            <x-front.legal-link url="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CXJPQG9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank" text="HUANUO Dual Monitor Stand" after="." />
            It's a single mount with two monitor arms, and it holds the monitors in place nicely.
            Each arm is flexible in where I can position them.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was previously using two separate monitor arms, but I felt having one single mount was much nicer and provided me
            with a cleaner setup.

            To free up desk space and add more flexibility, I added a

    <x-front.section-list-item title="Epomaker x Aula F99 Keyboard">
        <p>
            By far the best mechanical keyboard I've ever used. The
            <x-front.legal-link url="https://epomaker.com/products/epomaker-aula-f99?_pos=1&_sid=d2ca2dab0&_ss=r" target="_blank" text="Epomaker x Aula F99 Keyboard" />
            looks and sounds amazing out-of-the-box.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, I chose to put in

            tactile switches, along with some

            />.
            I love how the baby kangaroo switches sound and feel, and the retro keycaps paired nicely with this board in my opinion.
        </p>

        <p>
            My only complaint with this board is how much it flexes when changing out the switches.

    <x-front.section-list-item title="Logitech MX Master 3s Mouse">

            Even when not docked, I still prefer an external mouse for most operations. I really love the

            mouse. For me, it feels great to hold, and it also provides support for some macOS gestures like swiping up
            for mission control.

            I never was much of a watch person until I bought my Apple Watch Series 7. Now I feel naked if I leave home

            For websites and services that support Webauthn authentication, I use a

            security key. This particular key is nice because it works with both my MacBook and my iPhone without having
            to use any adapters.
        </p>

        <p>
            I highly recommend purchasing at least one of these to use a form of two-factor authentication for websites
            that support it.

            provides a convenient way to wirelessly charge my phone at the office, and also acts as a nice stand to keep
            my phone off the desk. It's MagSafe too, which is a plus.

            for a cheaper solution, but they still sound decent for my needs.
