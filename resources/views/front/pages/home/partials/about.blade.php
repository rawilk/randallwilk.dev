        <p>
            I'm a full-stack developer based in Wausau, WI. I'm passionate about PHP, and I specialize in the Laravel framework.
            Although I specialize in PHP, I didn't actually start out with this language.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the first languages I learned was c#. I learned software development using c# and WPF forms while working towards my Associate's degree.
            In 2016, I received my Associate of Applied Science in Software Development degree from
            <a href="https://ntc.edu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">
                Northcentral Technical College
            </a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Prior to receiving my Associate's degree, I started working for my first tech employer, however my work there involved using PHP and
            WordPress - neither of which I had any experience in. Because of this, I decided to make web development my focus for my Bachelor's degree,
            and in 2019 I received a Bachelor of Science in Web Technologies from
            <a href="https://www.bellevue.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">
                Bellevue University
            </a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Right around the time I received my Bachelor's, I started working for my current employer,
            <a href="https://riverwoodeducational.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">
                Riverwood Educational Services, Inc
            </a>
            . Although I do manage some client sites, the majority of my time here is spent building and maintaining a technology asset deployment
            system for charter schools.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of the technologies I'm most comfortable working with include PHP/Laravel, MySQL, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js and Laravel Livewire.
            In the past year or so, I've also started learning and using Filament, which allows me to easily create rich, robust admin panels
            without having to write a lot of boiler plate code that is usually required for them.
