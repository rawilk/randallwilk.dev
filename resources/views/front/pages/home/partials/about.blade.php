                    I'm Randall Wilk, a full-stack developer based in Wausau, WI. When it comes to programming,
                    I'm passionate about PHP and my preferred framework is Laravel.

                    Currently I'm a developer at <a href="https://cybrixsolutions.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Cybrix Solutions, LLC</a>.
                    I use a lot of open source software: PHP, Ubuntu, Laravel, Composer, NPM, ... are just a few that I use everyday. Whenever I can, I try to learn new
                    things about software development either through school or independent study. With how quickly the industry changes, I firmly believe you always need
                    to be learning in order to stay relevant.

                <p class="text-lg">
                    Some of the technologies I'm most comfortable working with are PHP/Laravel, MySQL, Tailwind CSS, AlpineJS, and Laravel Livewire.
                    I also have a lot of experience working with semantic, accessible, and SEO-friendly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including modern
                    ES syntax and build tools like Webpack).
