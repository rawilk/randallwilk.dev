Although I specialize in PHP, I didn't actually start out with this language.\n\nOne of the first languages I learned was c#. I learned software development using c# and WPF forms while working towards my Associate's degree. In 2016, I received my Associate of Applied Science in Software Development degree from [Northcentral Technical College](https://ntc.edu). \n\nPrior to receiving my Associate's degree, I started working for my first tech employer, Invizon, however my work there involved using PHP and WordPress - neither of which I had any experience in. Because of this, I decided to make web development my focus for my Bachelor's degree, and in 2019 I received a Bachelor of Science in Web Technologies from [Bellevue University](https://www.bellevue.edu/).\n\nRight around the time I received my Bachelor's, I started working for my current employer, [Riverwood Educational Services, Inc](https://riverwoodeducational.com). Although I do manage some client sites, the majority of my time here is spent building and maintaining a technology asset deployment system for charter schools. \n\nSome of the technologies I'm most comfortable working with include PHP/Laravel, MySQL, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js and Laravel Livewire. For testing, I've recently started using Pest PHP and I'm in the process of converting some of my open source package test suites into Pest.",
